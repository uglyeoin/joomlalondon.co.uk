/**
 * This handles Apache 401 Authorisation required messages. It is required when using .htaccess Maker (or Joomla!'s
 * own .htaccess as shipped in htaccess.txt) and administrator password protection and have also set an INVALID custom
 * ErrorDocument in Apache for HTTP 401 (Authorisation required). Apache will attempt to load the error document before
 * sending the HTTP basic authorisation headers to the browser. If the error document does not exist (it is an invalid
 * internal file path, typically with a .html or .shtml extension) the .htaccess SEF URL rewrwite rules will kick in and
 * ask Joomla! to handle the request. Since Joomla! cannot find a SEF URL of that name it returns an HTTP 404 Not Found
 * response. Apache sees that and freaks out, ending up in showing the 404 error page instead of sending the HTTP Basic
 * Authentication headers to the browser! This trick below detects the missing 401 custom error page redirection and
 * returns a **valid** HTTP 401 message, letting Apache continue its business.
 *
 * FOR CRYING OUT LOUD PEOPLE, FIX YOUR GARBAGE SERVERS!!!
